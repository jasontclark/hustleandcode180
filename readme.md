Hustle and Code 180
===================

Recently, I did a blog post about creating a 180 Day Coding Challenge to reach my goals of becoming a programming expert. This github repository documents most of the small projects that I will be completing as part of this challenge.

Here's a list of them (so far):

* tweepybot - A Python Twitter bot using Tweepy
* udemy-ultimate-python - All of the chapter exercises for the Ultimate Python Programming course on Udemy.
