Hustle and Code 180
===================

Not long ago, I did a blog post about creating a [180 Day Coding Challenge][180Days] to reach my goals of becoming a programming expert. This github repository documents most of the small projects that I will be completing as part of this challenge.

Here is a list of them (so far):
* python-next-level - All of the chapter exercises for the Python Next Level course on Udemy.
* mellotrello - A quick command-line utility for finding stale trello cards.
* brandywine - A command-line utility for searching movies reviews the with Rotten Tomatoes API.
* lpthw - All of the completed exercises for Learn Python the Hard Way.
* tweepybot - A Python Twitter bot using Tweepy
